                <h2>Business Analysis And Solution Program</h2>
                <p>The difference between short-form and long-form videos is simple: short-form videos are short, and long-form videos are long. To be more specific, short-form videos are typically under 10 minutes long, while long-form videos exceed that 10-minute mark. You’ll see a lot of short-form videos on social media. Target, for example, uses this video format on Instagram to advertise its products.</p>
                <p>You’ll typically see longer videos on a business’s website or YouTube. Video and podcast hosting provider, Wistia, uses long-form video to educate its audience about the cost of video production.</p>
